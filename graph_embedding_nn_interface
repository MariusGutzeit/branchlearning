Data needed in NN:
Define:
	n: the number of vertices
	p: the length of feature vectors

1. Solution Weight Matrix for all edges.
It should be an n*n 2-d numpy array s_M, where s_M[a][b] is the fraction of the edge e(a, b) in the solution.
2. Weight matrix W for all edges.
It's an n*n 2-d numpy array where W[a][b] is the weight of the edege e(a, b) where a, b is the index of the NO.a and NO.b vertex.
3. Adjacent Matrix for all vertices
It's an n*n 2-d numpy array where W[a][b] is the indicator for whether vertex a and vertex b are adjacent.
4. Label
It's a scalar.4.
