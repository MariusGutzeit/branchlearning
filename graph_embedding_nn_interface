Data needed in NN:
Define:
	n: the number of vertices
	p: the length of feature vectors

1. Indicator variable for all vectices.
It should be a n-length numpy array V, i.e. V= [1, 0, 1,....] and len(V) = n
2. Weight matrix W for all edges.
It's an n*n 2-d numpy array where W[a][b] is the weight of the edege e(a, b) where a, b is the index of the NO.a and NO.b vertex.
3. Adjacent Matrix for all vertices
It's an n*n 2-d numpy array where W[a][b] is the indicator for whether vertex a and vertex b are adjacent.
